# Installing maven

Firstly, we need to ensure **JAVA_HOME** enivronment variable exist. If it does not exist as environment variable set as permenantly as follows.  </p>

```{bash}
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Then, add the following code block to *.bashrc* then exit and save the file.</p>

``` {bash}
JAVA_HOME="lib/jvm/openjdk-21"
PATH= "$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export PATH
```
After that run the following on terminal.
```{bash}
source ~/.bashrc
```
After that check the environment variable.</p>
```{bash}
echo $JAVA_HOME
java -version
```
Output: 
```
openjdk version "21.0.8" 2025-07-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.8+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu124.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.8+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu124.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
```
Download Apache maven on the URL https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi </br>

Unzip the package by using following commands. </br>

```{bash}
unzip apache-maven-3.9.11-bin.zip
```

or

```{bash}
tar xzvf apache-maven-3.9.11-bin.tar.gz
```

Then copy or move the extracted folder to */opt/*

```{bash}
sudo cp -rf  apache-maven-3.9.11 /opt/
```

or 

```{bash}
sudo mv -rf  apache-maven-3.9.11 /opt/
```
Again open the .bashrc.
```{bash}
nano ~/.bashrc
```
add the following block to *.bashrc*.
```{bash}
M2_HOME="/opt/apache-maven-3.9.11"
PATH="$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export PATH
```
The command source ~/.bashrc is used to apply the changes made in the ~/.bashrc file immediately to the current Bash session.
```{bash}
source ~/.bashrc
```

Check the maven by the code:
```{bash}
mvn -v
```
Output:
```
Apache Maven 3.9.11 (3e54c93a704957b63ee3494413a2b544fd3d825b)
Maven home: /opt/apache-maven-3.9.11
Java version: 21.0.8, vendor: Ubuntu, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "6.14.0-24-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```

# Create first project

```{bash}
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.first.example -DartifactId=jcg-example -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```
By using the *mvn archetype:generate* command above, the first project has been initialized. </br>
-  **-DgroupID** declares the group id of project.
- **-DartifactId** declares the artifact id of project.
- **-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart** this archetype will create for us a basic java project with maven directories conventions that will be packaged as a jar file.
- **-DinteractiveMode=false** This parameter prevents Maven from prompting the user for project details (Group ID, Artifact ID, etc.) and allows the user to use the values specified in the command directly. This allows the command to be run non-interactively.


The generate command will take a few seconds to complete if you are using Maven for the first time since it needs to download all necessary plugins and artifactsÂ before it can begin the generation operation.
 As you can see, the chosen directory now has a new directory with the same name as the artifactId.  The updated directory structure is shown below.</br>

 ```
