# Apache Maven

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects, enabling the creation, management, and automation of your project.

In short, Maven's core functions are as follows:

## 1. Dependency Management

This is Maven's most important feature. When developing a project, we need external libraries (for example: Spring Framework, Hibernate, JUnit). Maven allows you to write the names and versions of these libraries (artifacts) in your project's main configuration file, pom.xml.

When you issue the command, Maven automatically downloads these libraries from a central repository (Maven Central), stores them in your local repository, and adds them to your project. This eliminates the hassle of manually downloading and adding libraries to your project.

## 2. Project Structure and Standardization

Maven defines a standard directory structure (folder layout) for projects. For example, source code is placed in the src/main/java folder, and test code in the src/test/java folder. This standardization allows developers working on different projects to easily understand the project's location and collaborate.

## 3. Automated Build Process

Maven automates the project's build process. It takes the project through a series of stages and defines a goal for each stage. These stages are:

Compile: Converts Java code into .class files.

Test: Runs tests on your project using tools like JUnit.

Package: Combines the compiled code and resources to create a .jar or .war file.

Install: Saves the built package to your local Maven repository for use by other projects.

All of these processes can be run automatically with a single command (such as mvn install).

## 4. Reporting and Documentation

Maven can generate various reports and documentation about your project. It simplifies project management by automatically reporting information such as the project's dependency list, test results, and code quality analysis.

In short, Maven simplifies the developer's work by consolidating a project's lifecycle (building, managing dependencies, compiling, testing, packaging, and deploying) under a single framework. This allows developers to focus directly on writing code rather than on the project's infrastructure.

# Installing maven

Firstly, we need to ensure **JAVA_HOME** enivronment variable exist. If it does not exist as environment variable set as permenantly as follows.  </p>

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Then, add the following code block to *.bashrc* then exit and save the file.</p>

``` bash
JAVA_HOME="lib/jvm/openjdk-21"
PATH= "$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export PATH
```
After that run the following on terminal.
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
After that check the environment variable.</p>
```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
java -version
```
Output: 
```
openjdk version "21.0.8" 2025-07-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.8+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu124.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.8+9-Ubuntu-0ubuntu124.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
```
Download Apache maven on the URL https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi </br>

Unzip the package by using following commands. </br>

```bash
unzip apache-maven-3.9.11-bin.zip
```

or

```bash
tar xzvf apache-maven-3.9.11-bin.tar.gz
```

Then copy or move the extracted folder to */opt/*

```bash
sudo cp -rf  apache-maven-3.9.11 /opt/
```

or 

```bash
sudo mv -rf  apache-maven-3.9.11 /opt/
```
Again open the .bashrc.
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
add the following block to *.bashrc*.
```bash
M2_HOME="/opt/apache-maven-3.9.11"
PATH="$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export PATH
```
The command source ~/.bashrc is used to apply the changes made in the ~/.bashrc file immediately to the current Bash session.
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Check the maven by the code:
```bash
mvn -v
```
Output:
```
Apache Maven 3.9.11 (3e54c93a704957b63ee3494413a2b544fd3d825b)
Maven home: /opt/apache-maven-3.9.11
Java version: 21.0.8, vendor: Ubuntu, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "6.14.0-24-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```

# Create first project

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.first.example -DartifactId=jcg-example -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```
By using the *mvn archetype:generate* command above, the first project has been initialized. </br>
-  **-DgroupID** declares the group id of project.
- **-DartifactId** declares the artifact id of project.
- **-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart** this archetype will create for us a basic java project with maven directories conventions that will be packaged as a jar file.
- **-DinteractiveMode=false** This parameter prevents Maven from prompting the user for project details (Group ID, Artifact ID, etc.) and allows the user to use the values specified in the command directly. This allows the command to be run non-interactively.


The generate command will take a few seconds to complete if you are using Maven for the first time since it needs to download all necessary plugins and artifactsÂ before it can begin the generation operation.
 As you can see, the chosen directory now has a new directory with the same name as the artifactId.  The updated directory structure is shown below.</br>

 ```
/jcg-example
    |
    ---- /src
            |
            ----/main/java/com/first/example
                    |
                    -----App.java
            |
            ----/test/java/com/first/example
                    |
                    -----AppTest.java
    |
    ----pom.xml
 ```

 To build your project, you can configure all project features, dependencies, repositories, plugins, etc. in a file called pom.xml (Project Object Model), which is defined by Maven.</p>

 Finally, by using Eclipse, the java project of this artifact is created and configurated as Maven project.

 # Hadoop

 ## The First "Hello-wrold"  Example

The following dependency block can be added into pom.xml (Project Object Managment) to use Hadoop.</br>

Firstly, we add the following block to pom.xml for hadoop dependency.

```
<dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
        <artifactId>hadoop-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```
